            <h2>Living the Dream</h2>
            <h3 class="subheading" > Some words about why I've chosen Chas Academy</h3>
            <p> Just a few years ago, I thought that the IT sector wasn't really for me, 
                but I challenged myself to learn more about it, 
                and I feel lucky to have found something I enjoy this much!
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to further move towards fullstack developement because I want to feel
                more confident in my skills, and I think an YH like Chas Academy can give me that.
                I also hope it will be a creative environment, where I can learn from my fellow students. 
                I thrive in social environments, so working with developement
                in a team is an important part of my dream for the future.
            </p>
            <h3 class="subheading" >And something about my dream profession</h3>
            <p>
                Another part of my dream is being able to use my previous
                experiences as a graphic designer in my work. That could mean
                working closely with the design team, developing their visions
                into working programmes.
            </p>
            <p>
                A role that currently interests me is working as a consultant. 
                I imagine it would give me the chance to tackle diverse projects, 
                continuously learn, and use both my programming skills and design 
                experience to create real value for clients. Ultimately, I want a 
                position where I can grow, contribute creatively, and be part of 
                a team that values collaboration and innovation.
                Also, rainy days can be nice.
